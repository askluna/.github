## Architecture

Ask Luna's architecture is built on a distributed state machine model, utilizing xState and Cloudflare Workers for scalable, real-time interactions between the AI intern and the user. The AI's memory is powered by graph and vector databases, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of information.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and knowledge graphs are employed to provide context-aware responses and actions. Sparse search models and reranking models optimize the AI's output for relevance and accuracy. API-based actions and headless browsers enable the AI to interact with various tools and perform tasks autonomously.

The system's role-based, multi-LLM design allows the AI intern to adapt to the specific needs of each small business. The tech stack includes TypeScript, Python, Cloudflare Workers, PostgreSQL, D1, AWS, Hugging Face, and modal.com, creating a robust and flexible platform that can scale with the business.
